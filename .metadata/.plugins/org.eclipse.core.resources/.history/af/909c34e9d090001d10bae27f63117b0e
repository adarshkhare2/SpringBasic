Issue:- There is one size catagorie the product is mapped but the business team deleted the catagorie. now they are getting errors because the product is still mapped/relation have with that size catagorie even that not exist.

Resolution:-----

with this query, we will get the categories which they deleted:-
---------------------------
select distinct(r.sourcepk) from cat2prodrel r where r.sourcepk not in (select pk from categories);


Query to get the source pks:
---------------------------
select distinct(r.sourcepk) from cat2prodrel r where r.sourcepk not in (select pk from categories);

 


Query to get mapping pk:
-----------------------
select * from cat2prodrel where sourcepk='8835814850702';

 

Impex to remove mapping:
-----------------------
REMOVE CategoryProductRelation;pk[unique=true]
